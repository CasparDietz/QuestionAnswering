# SQuAD 2.0 Question Answering Pipeline
This is a pipeline for performing question-answering tasks using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) 2.0.

Description
This repository contains code to train, validate, and test models for question answering tasks using the SQuAD 2.0 dataset. The SQuAD 2.0 dataset extends SQuAD1.1 to incorporate unanswerable questions, providing a more robust challenge for natural language understanding systems.

The pipeline includes:

Data loading and preprocessing scripts
Model architecture scripts
Training, validation, and testing scripts
Pretrained models
Visualization tools
Evaluation scripts to benchmark your model
